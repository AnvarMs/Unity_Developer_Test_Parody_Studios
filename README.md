### Standalone Builds

**Game Build:**
[Download for Windows/Mac](https://anvarms.itch.io/gravitypuzzle) 

## ⚠️ Platform Testing Status

| Platform | Build Status | Testing Status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Windows** | ✅ Built | ✅ Fully Tested |
| **Mac** | ✅ Built | ⚙️ Not Tested* |

**\*Mac Build Disclaimer:**  
The macOS build was generated using Unity's standard build pipeline with Universal 
architecture (Apple Silicon + Intel). However, I do not have access to Mac hardware 
for testing. The build follows Unity's recommended settings and should function 
correctly, but I cannot guarantee full compatibility without testing.

If you encounter any Mac-specific issues, please let me know and I'll be happy to 
address them. The Windows build has been thoroughly tested and verified working.

## 🎯 Objective

Collect all cubes scattered throughout the level within the 3-minute time limit. Use gravity manipulation to reach platforms that would otherwise be inaccessible.

## 🕹️ Controls

### Movement
- **W/A/S/D** - Move character`
- **Mouse** - Look around / Camera control

### Gravity Manipulation
- **Hold Right Mouse Button** - Enter gravity selection mode (hologram preview appears)
- **Move Mouse** - Rotate hologram to select gravity direction
- **Release Right Mouse Button** - Apply selected gravity direction


## 🎲 Gameplay Mechanics

### Gravity System
Players can change the direction of gravity to walk on walls and ceilings. Six gravity directions are available:
- Default (Down)
- Ceiling (Up)
- Left Wall
- Right Wall
- Front Wall
- Back Wall

### Win Condition
Collect all cubes before the 3-minute timer expires.

### Lose Conditions
- Timer runs out before all cubes are collected
- Player falls into the void (no surface contact for extended period)
